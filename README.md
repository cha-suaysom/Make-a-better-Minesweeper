# Build-a-better-Minesweeper
For Independent Study with Prof. Omar



### Observation

1. The number presented in the paper show a configuration of the minimum number of bombs needed in an m X n board so that any non-mine cell in k-minesweeper has positive number. This means that any 'click' will open a mine or only a single cell number, which is very challenging.


## minesweeper.py

A regular minesweeper game. The spot is picked by choosing x,y coordinates. Boardsize and number of bombs can be picked.
This is based on `https://github.com/RaemondBW/Python-Minesweeper/blob/master/minesweeper.py`

## newMinesweeper.py

Based on `minesweeper.py`, this file makes it so that the number instead of showing number of bombs in surrounded 3 X 3 cells (or any cells with distance 1), but a 5 X 5 cell (or any cells with distance 2). This can be useful for later when we look at k-domination number. From some of my experience this is 

## getExpression.py
(There is a way to put latex in markdown I'll figure it out at some point)
Parameter : k,m,n

This file calculate the value of $phi^{-1}_k(l)$ where $phi_k(i,j) = (k+1)i+kj$, then the closest point to the grid $G_{m,n}$ is found. An example in the paper $3,6,6$ is shown. 

## reveal_spots_minesweeper.py
Some spots are already revealed for 2-distance minesweeper. 

## limit_sweep_minesweeper.py
Limit the number of times you can play 1-distance or 2-distance sweep.

Todo: 1. Put this in actual minesweeper board, see what happens.
2. Observe other behavior and comes up with some conjecture

## Note/Observation

1. The number presented in the paper show a configuration of the minimum number of bombs needed in an m X n board so that any non-mine cell in k-minesweeper has positive number. This means that any 'click' will open a mine or only a single cell number, which is very challenging.

2. We can formulate the reveal spots problem mathematically as "For any subset S of vertices of grid graph G(m,n). Let f(m,n,k,S): V(G)->N be the function define on each vertex such that f(m,n,k,S) is the number of vertex in S distance k away from vertex (m,n). Let T (such that T intersects S is empty) be a subset of vertices in G(m,n) that we define f(m,n,k,S) on. What is the minimum value of |T| that would make S unique?
